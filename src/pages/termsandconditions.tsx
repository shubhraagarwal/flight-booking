                All airlines recommend the pregnant ladies to consult a doctor
                before traveling at any point during their pregnancy. We request
                all pregnant ladies to read pregnancy rules of the respective
                airlines before planning their trip. Some important points that
                need to be followed are:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Take a medical clearance from your healthcare provider or
                  doctor not more than 7 days before your journey stating that
                  you are fit to travel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should avoid taking flights if your pregnancy is
                  complicated and risky in nature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should take your due date into consideration for return
                  trip.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you are travelling on long-haul flights, identify if your
                  body allows you to take a hectic flight journey as the
                  seat-width may be uncomfortable in case of heavy pregnancy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                For detailed information about the same, please contact the
                airline you are travelling with.
